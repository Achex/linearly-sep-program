Machine Learning CW (First class)
This project takes a 2D set of points, circles.data, arranged as a class of dots in a circle surrounded by a ring of another class of dots. The aim is to convert the data to a change of basis using the Kernal trick for efficiency, such that the data becomes linearly seperable.
Made using Python 3.9.18.
