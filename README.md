Machine Learning CW (First class), made using Python 3.9.18.
This project takes a 2D set of points, circles.data, arranged as a class of dots in a circle surrounded by a ring of another class of dots. The aim is to convert the data to a change of basis using the Kernal trick for efficiency, such that the data becomes linearly seperable. The seperation is found by finding the minimum number of principle components required for serperation. This was found to be 3, and the seperation is shown in the 3rd image, the Z-axis principle component.\
\
Provided both .py and jupyter files.\
